For almost every task that you can perform with the mouse, you can use
the keyboard to perform the same task.  <firstterm>Shortcut keys</firstterm>
are keys that provide you with a quick way to perform a task.</para>

<para>You can use shortcut keys to perform general MATE Desktop tasks and
to work with interface items such as panels and windows. You can also use
shortcut keys in applications. To customize your shortcut keys, use the
<application>Keyboard Shortcuts</application> preference tool.  See
<xref linkend="prefs-keyboard-shortcuts"/> for more information about
configuring keyboard shortcuts.

[note]
  Many PC keyboards come with two special keys for the Windows operating system: a key with a Microsoft Windowsâ„¢ logo and a key for accessing context menus.

  In MATE, the Windows key is often configured to
  act as an additional modifier key, called the <firstterm>Super key</firstterm>.
  The context menu key can be used to access the context menu of the selected
  item, just as the <keycombo><keycap>Shift</keycap><keycap>F10</keycap></keycombo>
  keyboard shortcut can.

You can also modify the MATE Desktop preferences to use keyboard
accessibility features.  See <xref linkend="prefs-keyboard-a11y"/> for
more information about the keyboard accessibility features.

The following sections describe the shortcut keys that you can use
throughout the desktop and applications.
